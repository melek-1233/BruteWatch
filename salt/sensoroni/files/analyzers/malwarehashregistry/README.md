# Malware Hash Registry

## Description
Search Team Cymru's Malware Hash Registry for a file hash.

## Configuration Requirements

None.

**NOTE:** If you try to run the Malware Hash Registry analyzer but it results in a "Name or service not known" error, then it may be a DNS issue. Folks using 8.8.4.4 or 8.8.8.8 as their DNS resolver have reported this issue. A potential workaround is to switch to another DNS resolver like 1.1.1.1.
